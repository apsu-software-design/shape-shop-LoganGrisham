# Refactoring the Purchasing System.

This assignment is 100% original by James Church. All faults are his.

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Not on this assignment. On the rest, yes as listed, but this one was easy enough to just get rid of the clutter an reorganize.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 5 hours on and off. 


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 4


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I could refactor further than I already did and change the structure of some of the functions, such as the parameters. I would recommend that in
the future the level of refactor a student can do should be more clear. For example, I made the existing functions work to models and views but I would personally
just combine things like the separate arrays to reduce complexity. There's weird design quirks with how it exists now, so there could be much more done, but at that 
point it's a wholesale rebuild and would be as if the orignial code was never there.
